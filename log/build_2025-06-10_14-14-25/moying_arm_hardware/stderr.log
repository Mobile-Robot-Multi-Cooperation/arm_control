[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findelfin_ethercat_driver_plant.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "elfin_ethercat_driver_plant", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "elfin_ethercat_driver_plant" with any of the following names:

    elfin_ethercat_driver_plantConfig.cmake
    elfin_ethercat_driver_plant-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "elfin_ethercat_driver_plant" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "elfin_ethercat_driver_plant_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "elfin_ethercat_driver_plant"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
