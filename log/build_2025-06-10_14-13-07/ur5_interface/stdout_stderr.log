[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findocs2_core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ocs2_core", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ocs2_core" with
  any of the following names:

    ocs2_coreConfig.cmake
    ocs2_core-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ocs2_core" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ocs2_core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ocs2_core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
