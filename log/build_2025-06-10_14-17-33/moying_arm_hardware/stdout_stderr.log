[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbaichuan_arm_dynamics_models.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "baichuan_arm_dynamics_models", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "baichuan_arm_dynamics_models" with any of the following names:

    baichuan_arm_dynamics_modelsConfig.cmake
    baichuan_arm_dynamics_models-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "baichuan_arm_dynamics_models" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "baichuan_arm_dynamics_models_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "baichuan_arm_dynamics_models"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
